            <h2>Without Control-Flow</h2>
            <pre>This Solidity smart contract implements the "Concentrated Voting Power" (CVP) token, an ERC-20 token with added delegation functionality. Here's a breakdown:

**Core Functionality:**

*   **ERC-20 Token:** Implements the basic ERC-20 token standard, including `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `totalSupply`, `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `approve`, and `transferFrom`. It uses `uint96` for balances and allowances, potentially limiting the maximum values compared to standard ERC-20 implementations.

*   **Delegation:** Allows token holders to delegate their voting power to other addresses. This is implemented using the `delegate` and `delegateBySig` functions.  `delegateBySig` allows delegation via an off-chain signed message, adhering to EIP-712 for secure signature verification.

*   **Voting Power Tracking:**  Tracks voting power using checkpoints. The `checkpoints` mapping stores historical vote balances at different block numbers. The `numCheckpoints` mapping keeps track of the number of checkpoints for each address. This is used to determine the voting power of an account at a specific past block using `getPriorVotes`. This functionality is crucial for on-chain governance.

**Key Features and Implementation Details:**

*   **`uint96` Balances and Allowances:**  Uses `uint96` for `balances` and `allowances`, which is smaller than the standard `uint256` used in many ERC-20 tokens. This choice reduces gas costs but limits the maximum token supply and allowance amounts. Safe math functions (`safe96`, `add96`, `sub96`) are used to prevent overflows and underflows when operating on `uint96` values.

*   **Checkpoints for Historical Voting Power:** The `checkpoints` data structure and related functions (`getCurrentVotes`, `getPriorVotes`, `_writeCheckpoint`) are critical for tracking voting power over time.  `getPriorVotes` enables querying the voting power of an account at any past block.

*   **EIP-712 Delegation:**  The `delegateBySig` function implements EIP-712, allowing users to delegate their voting power by signing a message off-chain. This is more gas-efficient than on-chain delegation as it requires only one transaction, even if multiple users delegate to the same delegatee. It uses `DOMAIN_TYPEHASH` and `DELEGATION_TYPEHASH` to define the structure of the signed message. Nonces are used to prevent replay attacks.

*   **Event Emission:** Emits standard ERC-20 events (`Transfer`, `Approval`) and custom events for delegation (`DelegateChanged`, `DelegateVotesChanged`).

*   **Safety Checks:** Includes safety checks to prevent common errors like transferring from or to the zero address, exceeding balance, overflows, and underflows.

**Potential Audit Considerations:**

*   **`uint96` Limitations:** The use of `uint96` for balances and allowances should be carefully considered.  It limits the total token supply and maximum allowance a user can set. Assess whether `uint96` is sufficient for the intended use case, or if the standard `uint256` should be used to avoid potential limitations.

*   **Replay Attack Prevention:** The `delegateBySig` function uses a nonce to prevent replay attacks.  Ensure that the nonce update mechanism is correct and that there are no potential vulnerabilities related to nonce management.

*   **Front Running:**  While not explicitly a problem in the provided code, ensure that any contracts interacting with CVP tokens and using `getPriorVotes` are protected against front-running attacks. A malicious actor could potentially influence vote outcomes by manipulating their balance just before a critical vote calculation.

*   **Gas Optimization:** The contract could be further optimized for gas efficiency, especially the `_moveDelegates` and `_writeCheckpoint` functions which are called frequently. Consider using more efficient data structures or algorithms where possible.

*   **Block Number Dependency:** `getPriorVotes` relies on `block.number`. While it checks if the requested block is in the future, relying on block numbers can be problematic if block re-orgs occur. Consider the implications of block re-orgs on voting power calculations.

In summary, the contract is a well-structured ERC-20 token with delegation features tailored for governance. The use of checkpoints for historical voting power is a standard and effective technique. The auditor should focus on the limitations introduced by `uint96`, the security of the EIP-712 implementation, potential front-running vectors, and gas optimization opportunities.</pre>

            <h2>With Control-Flow</h2>
            <pre>Here's a summary of the provided Solidity smart contract:

**Contract Summary: Cvp (Concentrated Voting Power)**

**Purpose:** The `Cvp` contract implements a token with voting delegation capabilities, likely intended for governance within a decentralized system. It's based on the ERC-20 standard but adds functionality for users to delegate their voting power to other accounts.

**Key Functions and Relationships:**

*   **Constructor:** Initializes the contract by minting the entire `totalSupply` of tokens to a specified account.

*   **ERC-20 Functions:**
    *   `allowance(address account, address spender)`:  Returns the amount of tokens a `spender` is allowed to spend on behalf of an `account`.
    *   `approve(address spender, uint rawAmount)`: Allows a `spender` to transfer tokens from the caller's account, up to the specified `amount`. Standard ERC-20 approval mechanism.
    *   `balanceOf(address account)`: Returns the token balance of an `account`.
    *   `transfer(address dst, uint rawAmount)`: Transfers tokens from the caller's account to `dst`.
    *   `transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint rawAmount)`: Transfers tokens from `src` to `dst` if the caller is approved to spend on behalf of `src`.

*   **Delegation Functions:**
    *   `delegate(address delegatee)`: Delegates the caller's voting power to the `delegatee`.  This updates the `delegates` mapping and adjusts the voting power checkpoints.
    *   `delegateBySig(address delegatee, uint nonce, uint expiry, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)`:  Allows delegation via an EIP-712 signature.  This enables off-chain signing of delegation requests. It verifies the signature, nonce, and expiry before delegating.

*   **Voting Power Functions:**
    *   `getCurrentVotes(address account)`: Returns the current voting power of an account. This is based on the most recent checkpoint.
    *   `getPriorVotes(address account, uint blockNumber)`:  Returns the voting power of an account at a specific `blockNumber`.  This is crucial for retroactive voting or snapshot governance.

*   **Internal Functions:**
    *   `_delegate(address delegator, address delegatee)`: Internal function to perform the actual delegation logic, updating the delegate and moving voting power.
    *   `_transferTokens(address src, address dst, uint96 amount)`: Internal function to handle the actual token transfer logic, updating balances and moving delegated votes.
    *   `_moveDelegates(address srcRep, address dstRep, uint96 amount)`: Adjusts the voting power of the source and destination delegates based on a transfer or delegation.  Creates checkpoints to record vote changes.
    *   `_writeCheckpoint(address delegatee, uint32 nCheckpoints, uint96 oldVotes, uint96 newVotes)`: Writes a new checkpoint for an account's voting power at the current block.
    *   `safe32(uint n, string memory errorMessage)`: Safely casts uint to uint32, throwing an error if overflow occurrs
    *   `safe96(uint n, string memory errorMessage)`: Safely casts uint to uint96, throwing an error if overflow occurrs
    *   `add96(uint96 a, uint96 b, string memory errorMessage)`: Safely adds two uint96 values, throwing an error if overflow occurrs
    *   `sub96(uint96 a, uint96 b, string memory errorMessage)`: Safely subtracts two uint96 values, throwing an error if underflow occurrs

**Potential Security Considerations:**

1.  **Replay Attack on `delegateBySig`:** While the `delegateBySig` function uses a nonce to prevent replay attacks, it increments the nonce *before* calling `_delegate`. If `_delegate` reverts for any reason after the nonce has been incremented, the nonce is lost, and the signature becomes unusable.

2.  **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** The code uses `safe96`, `add96`, and `sub96` functions to prevent overflows and underflows on `uint96` values. However, review all arithmetic operations carefully, especially in `_moveDelegates` and `_transferTokens`, to ensure no edge cases are missed.

3.  **Front Running of `delegateBySig`:** An attacker could potentially front-run a `delegateBySig` transaction with their own transaction that calls a function using `getCurrentVotes`. Since the votes are only updated in `_moveDelegates`, which is called *after* the signature validation in `delegateBySig`, the attacker might be able to exploit a brief window of opportunity.

4.  **Immutability of `totalSupply`:** The `totalSupply` is defined as `constant`. Once deployed, the total supply of tokens cannot be changed. This might be a desired feature, but it's essential to confirm that this is the intended behavior.

5.  **Approvals and Front-Running (Standard ERC-20 Issue):**  The `approve` function is subject to the standard ERC-20 approval front-running issue.  If a user approves a large amount to a spender and then approves a smaller amount shortly after, an attacker could front-run the second approval and spend the larger, original amount.

6.  **Potential denial of service in vote delegation.** If there are many checkpoints created, calls to `getPriorVotes` could take a long time potentially DOSing the contract.

In summary, the `Cvp` contract is a voting power token built on the ERC-20 standard, with added delegation functionality. Security considerations revolve around replay attacks, integer overflows/underflows, and standard ERC-20 approval issues. Thorough testing and formal verification techniques are highly recommended.</pre>
